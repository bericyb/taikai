## History

Forge Utah Foundation is a local tech community in Utah built for the developers, engineers, data scientists-- for the true builders of tech. We host several free and open developer groups and we are a big user of Meetup.com. Unfortunately, Meetup doesn't provide discounts for not-for-profit organizations and the cost has become extremely prohibitive. Since we are a group of technologists, we thought "let's build our own!". Hopefully other communities will find it beneficial as well.
